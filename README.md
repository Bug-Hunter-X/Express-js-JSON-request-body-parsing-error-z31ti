This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where the JSON request body is not parsed correctly. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The issue arises from improper middleware configuration, leading to the server receiving an empty request body. The solution involves correctly configuring the `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON data before handling the request.
